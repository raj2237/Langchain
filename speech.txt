"Good evening, everyone.
First, let me say it’s an absolute honor to be here and speak to all of you today. I’ve often believed that life, much like cricket, isn’t just about those moments when the scoreboard is in your favor or when the crowd is cheering for you. It’s about those times when the going gets tough, and the pressure is on you to deliver.

I’ve been blessed to play this incredible game, one that teaches you resilience every single day. When I step onto that pitch, I remind myself of one thing: It’s not just about talent or skill; it’s about intent. How badly do you want to succeed? How willing are you to put your heart on the line, to give it everything you’ve got, even when you’re down?

Success, for me, has never been about stats or milestones. Yes, they look great, but what truly matters is the mindset you bring. Hard work, focus, and discipline – these are the three pillars of my life. They’re not glamorous, and they’re definitely not shortcuts, but I’ve realized that consistency in effort is what leads to long-term excellence.

One thing I’ve learned is to never fear failure. Failure is the fuel for success. It’s in those low moments that you discover who you truly are. That’s when you learn to take responsibility, adapt, and move forward.

Another important lesson is respect – respect for the game, respect for people, and respect for your process. The moment you let ego or complacency take over, you lose sight of your goals. No matter where you reach in life, always keep your hunger alive, keep that fire within you burning.

Lastly, remember to enjoy the journey. Celebrate your wins, but don’t stop there. Always strive to learn, to grow, to become a better version of yourself. That’s what greatness is
